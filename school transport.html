            <li>Parents are requested to keep their child ready on time before the bus comes to pick him/her up. The bus driver will not be able to wait for long, as it would disturb the whole schedule resulting in the bus reaching late to school and thus affecting all the children in the bus. Hence please ensure that your child is at the stop 5 minutes before scheduled time.
            </li>
            
            <li>Delay in picking up or dropping your child would be rare. This may happen due to unavoidable circumstances. Kindly co-operate.</li>
            
            <li>The children should stay away from the main road until the bus arrives.</li>
            
            <li>No student should come near the entry door of the bus unless is halted.</li>
            
            <li>The front door of the bus is the only authorized entrance and exit.</li>
            
            <li>Unruly behavior like shrieking, shouting and use of foul language is strictly prohibited. courteous behavior is expected at all times.</li>
            
            <li>The driver's attention must not be distracted for any reason.</li>
            
            <li>Any temporary change in the residential address and consequent change of route will not be permitted as a rule. Parents are requested to note that we cannot allow any child to board another bus (not the regular route bus) as it causes difficulties to the management.</li>
